## The Simple ELT Process

Data infrastructure can be broken down into a simple ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process:

1. **Extract** - Pull data from your sources (apps, databases, APIs)

2. **Load** - Store this data in a central location (data warehouse)

3. **Transform** - Clean and reshape the data for analysis

4. **Visualize** - Create dashboards and reports


## Recommended Tech Stack for Early-Stage Startups

Here's a simple, cost-effective stack to get you started:

1. Data Warehouse: Google BigQuery
BigQuery offers a generous free tier and scales as you grow. It's serverless, so there's no infrastructure to manage.

2. Data Orchestration: Airflow Cloud
Airflow Cloud helps you schedule and run your data pipelines. It handles the extraction and loading parts of the process.

3. Data Transformation: dbt Cloud
dbt (data build tool) Cloud makes it easy to transform your data using SQL. It has a free tier for small teams and integrates well with BigQuery.

4. Data Visualization: Looker Studio
Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) is completely free and connects directly to BigQuery. It allows you to create dashboards without any coding.

## Getting Started

1. Set up BigQuery
Create a Google Cloud account and set up a BigQuery project

2. Configure Airflow Cloud
Set up pipelines to extract data from your sources

3. Implement dbt
Create transformation models to clean and organize your data

4. Build dashboards
Connect Looker Studio to BigQuery and create your first visualizations

## Scaling Up

This stack can grow with your startup. As your data needs become more complex, you can:

- Add more data sources to your pipelines

- Create more sophisticated transformations

- Build advanced dashboards

- Upgrade to paid tiers as needed

## Conclusion

You don't need a complex or expensive data stack to start making data-driven decisions. By focusing on the basics of ELT and using cloud-based tools with free tiers, you can build a solid foundation for your data infrastructure that will support your startup as it grows.
